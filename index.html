<p id="background-p">
    After former Monarch of Russia Peter I died, there was a long struggle for who took the throne.
    Eventually, Peter III took control, and he married Catherine, who was a German Princess, as well as her second cousin.
    She became known for her talent at dueling, because it was what occupied much of her time as a child. In 1762, Peter III was assassinated.
    It is believed that Catherine had a role in the assassination, though nothing could be proved.
    Because of his death, however, Catherine took the throne and went on to become the longest lasting female Russian monarch. She mainly stayed in power by 
    giving the upper class benefits and crushing the lower class. She did this by creating things like education programs for the upper class children to gain their favor, and then
    using her total power over military to crush any riots made by the lower class. Some other notable achievements include strengthening the economy and military.
